# DotNet (CIL) backend — design rules and working notes

Prototype Kotlin → .NET CIL target. Code lives in `compiler/ir/backend.dotnet/` (backend) and
`compiler/cli/cli-dotnet/` (CLI, K2 phased pipeline only). IL-text golden tests are the primary
validation: test data in `compiler/testData/codegen/dotnet/ilText/`, runners generated from
`compiler/fir/fir2ir/testFixtures/.../codegen/AbstractDotNetIlTextTest.kt` (`./gradlew generateTests`).
CLI tests in `compiler/testData/cli/dotnet/`. Box tests exist but executing generated unsigned
`.exe` files may be blocked by local OS policy; "ilasm assembles cleanly" is the executable bar.

## Design rules

- Before implementing DotNet backend behavior, inspect how the mature JVM/JS/WASM/Native targets
  solve the same problem, then make an explicit .NET-specific decision. Do not invent a separate
  approach unless the CLR platform model gives a concrete reason.
- When reporting an implemented DotNet backend feature, state which mature target it follows. If the
  implementation deviates, state the target it deviates from and the CLR-specific reason.
- If JVM uses an intrinsic registry for a behavior, DotNet wires that behavior through
  `DotNetIlIntrinsicMethods` too, unless there is a concrete platform reason not to. "Needed later"
  is not a valid reason to skip the registry shape; add the registry entry now and let unsupported
  cases fail explicitly.
- IL codegen fails on unsupported IR (`dotNetUnsupported()`) instead of emitting fallback IL such as
  empty strings or zero values. `DotNetIlEmitter` skips uncompilable functions to a fixpoint
  (callers of skipped functions are skipped too) and errors only when the entry point is affected.

## Established decisions

- IL codegen split: `DotNetIlEmitter` (module orchestration), `DotNetIlClassCodegen` (class shell,
  method dispatch), `DotNetIlMethodCodegen` (bodies/statements), `DotNetIlExpressionCodegen`
  (expressions), `DotNetIlMethodContext` (slots/labels/maxstack/stack verification),
  `DotNetIlCodegenSupport` (type mapping, signatures, escaping), `DotNetIlType` (value types vs
  return types).
- String concatenation follows the mature target shape: `FlattenStringConcatenationLowering`, then
  `DotNetStringConcatenationLowering`, then IL codegen handles `String.plus`/`toString` intrinsics.
  Avoid ad-hoc IrWhen/boolean handling inside string emission.
- Lowerings run through `NamedCompilerPhase`/`PhaseEngine`, measured as `PhaseType.IrLowering`.
- Main selection uses `DotNetMainFunctionDetector`. No wrapper is generated when the selected
  Kotlin `main` shape already maps to a valid CLR `.entrypoint` method (ECMA-335 allows
  parameterless or `string[]` entry points); add a wrapper only when a supported source shape needs one.
- Kotlin `Unit` is not an IL value type. CLR `void` is only a return encoding; Unit-returning
  functions are emitted as `void`, and `IMPLICIT_COERCION_TO_UNIT` discards values with `pop`.
- Local `val`/`var` follows the JVM/WASM model conceptually: the method context maps IR value
  symbols to slots. CLR keeps argument slots (`ldarg`) separate from `.locals init` slots
  (`ldloc`/`stloc`).
- `if`/`when` follows JVM/WASM `IrWhen` handling: evaluate conditions, `brfalse` to next branch,
  `br` to the end label after a matched branch.
- Equality follows JVM's intrinsic-registry shape: `Int`/`Boolean` use `ceq`, `String ==` uses
  `System.String::op_Equality`, `String ===` uses reference `ceq`. Boxed/object equality fallback is
  deferred until the backend has an object/runtime model.
- The fake `kotlin.io.println` stdlib source (`DotNetStdlibSource`) is filtered through the intrinsic
  registry and is not emitted as a class of its own.
- Generics stance: the type representation stays structural so that future generics can target real
  CLR reified generics (Roslyn shape), not JVM-style erasure. Unsupported generic shapes are
  rejected, never erased.
