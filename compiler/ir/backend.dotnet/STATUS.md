# Kotlin/.NET development status

This file is the current integration snapshot. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
before changing the target. Future ordering belongs in the
[way forward](docs/programmes/way-forward.md), durable representation rules in
ADRs, and dated evidence in [`docs/archive`](docs/archive/README.md).

## Current checkpoint

- Integration branch: `dotnet`. Completed feature checkpoints are promoted to
  local `dotnet` and `fork/dotnet` together.
- Reviewed upstream base:
  `88a184ab89279617dbfe4e89ba9831ed1b43c863`.
- Physical library ABI 69, generic-owner artifact schema 22, and compiler/
  runtime surface 60 are current. Git owns the exact promoted commit identity.
- The production-inert generic-owner authority consolidation is closed. It
  separates Kotlin logical authority, CLR declaration authority, per-value
  physical provenance, late operation routing, and producer-wide state.
- Nothing has shipped and no Kotlin/.NET ABI is frozen. Prototype identities
  may still be replaced atomically.

The detailed checkpoint evidence and the disposition of earlier bounded proofs
are in the
[2026-09-05 consolidation archive](docs/archive/generic-owner-physical-authority-consolidation-2026-09-05.md).
The reviewed 291-commit upstream integration, replay preservation, bounded
adaptations, and post-rebase gate are in the
[2026-09-05 upstream-sync archive](docs/archive/upstream-sync-2026-09-05.md).
Current representation rules are linked from the navigation section below.

## Production contract

- Kotlin Common declarations and Kotlin IR/KLIB remain logical authority.
  Emitted or retained CLR metadata remains physical authority.
- Kotlin-produced libraries remain self-describing DLLs containing their KLIB
  and physical binding records.
- Kotlin-owned generic classes and interfaces still use the accepted erased
  production ABI. CLR-generic owners remain rehearsal-only until one complete
  family can switch atomically with an exact inverse and rollback.
- The candidate retains one receiver identity and one authoritative state.
  Proven natural CLR-generic routes are preferred; semantic capabilities are
  used only for Kotlin views the CLR cannot truthfully name. No wrapper, proxy,
  shadow state, or fabricated CLR construction repairs a representation gap.
- Retained foreign CLR metadata is terminal physical authority for imported
  declarations. Source backing does not imply current-emitter ownership.
- BK-1 remains the only accepted target-specific cast change. Its scope belongs
  to the
  [semantic-authority decision](docs/decisions/kotlin-semantic-authority-and-platform-freedom.md)
  and [breaking-change ledger](docs/decisions/breaking-kotlin-changes.md).

## Latest verification

The 291-commit upstream integration through
`88a184ab89279617dbfe4e89ba9831ed1b43c863` completed on 2026-09-05. The
conflict-free 733-patch replay retained every target patch; three bounded
follow-up commits align the target-model build convention, reject null
physical-ABI declarations, and accept upstream rich property-reference
parameter names. The detailed preservation and shared-path evidence is in the
[upstream-sync archive](docs/archive/upstream-sync-2026-09-05.md).

The latest ABI-69/schema-22 target-wide aggregate includes the generated
generic-SAM-wrapper slice. Direct JUnit XML audit found 212 suites and 2,817
tests, with zero failures, errors, or skips:

| Root | Suites | Tests |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| backend | 22 | 400 |
| `dotnet.ir` | 1 | 6 |
| FIR2IR | 187 | 2,283 |
| integration | 2 | 128 |

FIR2IR and integration were rebuilt explicitly after their adaptations, then
the public target aggregate completed with:

```text
.\gradlew.bat --max-workers=1 :compiler:backend.dotnet:dotNetTest -q
```

The focused post-rebase generic-owner matrix also passed in candidate and
production-erased inverse modes through PSI and LightTree on .NET 10 and
Framework 4.8. Exact commands, fixture scope, the one non-reproduced filesystem
failure, and direct XML counts are preserved in the upstream-sync archive.

## Active work

Resume the source-built Runtime/Stdlib generic-owner rehearsal census beyond
the closed generated-SAM-owner case within phase 1 of the way forward. The next
real failure selects the next structural provenance, placement, operation, or
state rule. Do not add declaration, package, collection, `Map`, member-name,
IR-origin, or stdlib exceptions.

The next slice must preserve ordinary C# overrides and implementations: hidden
semantic compiler ABI cannot become a second source-level obligation. It must
also keep production erased and prove the same focused inverse before promotion.

## Current blockers

- The shared value/operation grammar is still deliberately bounded. Broader
  MethodSpec vectors, nullable/bottom/unknown joins, captures, properties,
  conversions, multiple members, defaults, and deeper inheritance/MethodImpl
  graphs require independent proofs.
- Producer-wide state does not yet cover every open writer graph, array,
  volatile, nullable/value-class, external-state, or mixed-construction case.
- The complete Runtime/Stdlib family graph and wider separately compiled
  Kotlin/C# producer, subclass, implementation, and consumer matrix remain open.
- ReadyToRun, trimming, NativeAOT, reflection/tooling, representative
  applications and measurements, and exact migration rollback still block any
  production cutover.
